          This is the sidebar. Inside the sidebar has something short or brief
          that isn't as important or as content heavy as the main paragraph.
          This could be something like a Our Story section about the content
          that doesn't necessarily need to tkae up the entire main screen or
          article. This could also be a mini biography about the writer if it's
          an excerpt.
